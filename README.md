## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[StackOverflow was my main friend during this project. I also used Google heavily which linked me to different blogs that had information I needed.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I faced in creating this project was understanding the logic behind how the game worked. That took me the longest to fully understand. I was confused as to how the code can follow what the user presses and compare it to the pattern. Once I understood that, creating more features the game was easy. The way I overcame this problem was by researching. I took a look different JavaScript programs that are similar and tried to use my understanding of that code to understand this one. I also used code documentation to help me with syntax and similar issues.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Some questions about web development I have is what the process of is creating huge websites like Amazon or Facebook.  The project I created seemed so simple compared to what these bigger websites look like so I would love to know what exactly goes into them. Are different programming languages needed to further develop a website?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[A few things I would work on this project if I had extra time would be to clean up how it looks. I feel as if the design of the game could look way cleaner. I would have also added extra features such as the timer and custom sounds. I would also add a feature where the pictures are randomly changed every game so that a person whoâ€™s coming back to the game wont find it boring.]
